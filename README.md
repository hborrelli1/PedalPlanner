## PedalPlanner
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
PedalPlanner is an app that allows the user to search, plan, and create rides to invite friends. The app shows past and up-coming rides and displays metrics that would be based on a users past rides, pulling data like distance and elevation gain from the trail data.  

The app pulls information from [MTB Project Data](https://www.mtbproject.com/data).
Edit:
MTB Project has been aquired from onX and they have deprecated these public API's :(. I'm working on access to a new api.

### Learning Goals
1. Demonstrate the mastery of the following technologies:
    - React
    - Redux
    - Router
    - Asynchronous JavaScript
2. Work within constraints to deliver a unique product for your audience which helps them in some way. Your project must utilize your assigned API and technology, and must be built for your assigned audience.
3. Your applications should have the following core functionality:
Display the data from the API in a way that applies directly to your audience
Ability for users to store/manipulate the data displayed in the application, such as favoriting or adding to a list
